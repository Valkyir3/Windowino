# Windowino
Automatic window for cats, opening by proximity of BLE chip and sending notifications to owner

Windowino detects BLE collar chip and will open up when the cat arrives to a certain distance. windowino will monitor the cat location by two ultrasonic sensors and will send notification to the owner if the cat is inside or outside. incase the cat is out for too long a notification will be sent also. there is a safe mechanism which will prevent the window from closing on a living being or an object. notification will be sent every time the window is opening, time and date will be taken and placed into a chart. by that the cat's behviour can be monitored.

I created this device to make my life easier. it's tough to get up at 3 AM and go down three cases of stairs just to crack open a window and do the same thing when he wants in.
